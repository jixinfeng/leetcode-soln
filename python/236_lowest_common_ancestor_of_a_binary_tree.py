"""
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in
the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is
defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w
as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another
example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself
