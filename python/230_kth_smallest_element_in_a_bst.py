"""
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth
smallest element in it.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
routine?

Hint:

    Try to utilize the property of a BST.

    What if you could modify the BST node's structure?

    The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
